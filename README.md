# UnityVOIP
Real time peer to peer voice chat in Unity, using CSCore, NSpeex, and UnityP2P


Edit: I realized that this doesn't work for more than one speaker and has a few bugs, it is almost ready with those fixed but wait a few min until I remove this message to test it

Edit edit: Fixed, it should work with any number of speakers now. The audio quality isn't very good but it should work with very little delay :) I'll make tweaks later to let you change the audio quality if you want
